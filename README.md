This is a c-project, written at Jan,14, in Operating System course in Tel-Aviv University
We create a chat room application, using sockets based windows API.
The chat room is multi-threaded, including console/log-files UI. It can be used as example code for multi-threaded,socket programming. We strongly believe in clean code, close to OOD as possible
 We wish you luck, and hopefull our code might help
